# Menu Creator!
A Burger Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Materialize

## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any menu item to add it to the menu. This also adds the new menu item entry into the MySQL database. The initial item entry is added along with a description and a price. The price is not required in the case where the menu is for a party or home meal.
